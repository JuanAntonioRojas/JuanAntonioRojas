- I share some of Mike Gancarz' Unix Philosophy (1994):
    1. Small is beautiful
    2. Make each program do one thing well
    3. Build a prototype asap

- As well as some of Eric S. Raymond's Unix Philosophy (1994):
    1. Build modular programs
    2. Write simple, readable, robust and transparent programs
    3. Build on potential users' expected knowledge
 
- Finally, imo, UX should be exiting, fun, engaging and high impact
    and a team should be divided into PMs, Designers, Developers and QA
